                <br>
              <p>Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.
                The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.
                When these fossil fuels burn, they releases greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.

                <div><h1>WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF CLIMATIC CHAGES?</h1>
                  <hr>
                    <p>There are many “natural” and “anthropogenic” factors that contribute to climate change. The rapid rate and the magnitude of climate change occurring now that is of great concern worldwide. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb heat radiation. Human activity has increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, leading to more heat retention and an increase in surface temperatures. Atmospheric aerosols alter climate by scattering and absorbing solar and infrared radiation and they may also change the microphysical and chemical properties of clouds. Finally, land-use changes, such as deforestation have led to changes in the amount of sunlight reflected from the ground back into space.
                      Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock. This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming

              <p>1.The global average temperature in 2019 was 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, according to WMO.<br>
                2.2019 concluded a decade of exceptional global heat, retreating ice and record sea levels driven by greenhouse gases produced by human activities. (WMO)<br>
                3.30 per cent of the world’s population is exposed to deadly heat waves more than 20 days a year.<br>
                4.Average temperatures for the five-year (2015-2019) and ten-year (2010-2019) periods are the highest on record. (WMO)
                2019 was the second hottest year on record.<br>
                5.In 2019, total greenhouse gas emissions, including land-use change, reached a new high of 59.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e).<br>
                6.Based on today’s insufficient global commitments to reduce climate polluting emissions, a rebound in greenhouse gases from a return to high-carbon societies after the pandemic may push 2030 emissions even higher – up to 60 GtCO2e. (EGR, 2020)
